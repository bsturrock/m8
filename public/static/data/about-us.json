    "about-us" : ["At M8, our passion for crafting fresh and easily enjoyable beer comes alive with an Aussie flair. Our story originated among a group of friends who shared a deep appreciation for beer and a desire to bring something distinctive to the brewing scene. The opportunity to establish our brewery arose when the accomplished Checkerspot Brewery relocated, leaving behind their award-winning equipment.", "Infused with our Australian roots and a commitment to producing top-notch beer, M8 Brewery has evolved into a vibrant and inviting destination to gather with friends. Our tap room offers a unique experience, serving cold beer directly from the tanks, allowing you to savor a variety of our meticulously crafted beer styles. Complementing our brews is a delectable menu featuring Aussie-inspired cuisine.", "Join us at M8 Brewery for a memorable time, where you can share a cold M8 Beer with your mates and immerse yourself in the lively atmosphere of our brewery!"],
    "why-baltimore" : "Jeff (the guy with hair in the photo) grew up on the sunny Gold Coast in Australia and always loved beer, especially craft beer with flavour! Jeff was a professional squash player (silly sport we know) and a post game beer was his favourite! When he came to Baltimore in 1999, Jeff fell in love with this town and when the chance to start a brewery here came, he jumped like a kangaroo! We aren't letting Jeff brew the beer, but we can guarantee he will be trying every single one that we produce the first chance he gets! Come grab a beer with him some time, he loves a chat! (P.S. The bald guy is world famous squash player and beer aficionado Chris Walker)."
